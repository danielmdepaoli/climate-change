# climate-change

"Project Description
In this project, you will choose a topic and find all the relevant data yourself from Kaggle. Afterwards, you should enrich it by connecting to an API, find a dataset or scrape data from the web. You then must organize, clean and analyse the data you find and present your findings in a presentation (you may use plots!).


Project Goals
Learn how to develop an interesting question and find the data to answer it.
Learn how to obtain data from different sources, including APIs, open source datasets and/or scrape data from the web.
Build a database from the data you find for the whole team to use.
Explain more complex arguments with plots."

The question I wanted to find answers to was "How is the temperature in Portugal changing compared to the rest of the World?".

I got my data from a Worldwide Temperature Kaggle dataset, and crossed referenced with the Global Warming and Climate Change API, this way, I was able to find relevant information, which was then presented in the following Canva slide presentation.
